<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This simple cauliflower soup is made with just five ingredients, including salt! It's a quick and easy weeknight meal that's easy to dress up or down. Dinner is served!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
    <li>1 quart water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter (more if the cauliflower is extra large)</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Chopped chives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the cauliflower florets in salted water:</h3> 

        <p>Bring 1 quart of water to a rolling boil in a medium-sized pot. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to the water.</p> 
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Purée the cooked cauliflower in batches:</h3>

        <p>Working in batches, fill a blender half-way with cooked cauliflower, add enough cooking water to the blender bowl so that it comes up a quarter of the way. Purée until smooth. You want the consistency to be that of soup, so if you need to add more water, do so.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Add the salt and butter:</h3>

        <p>For each blender batch, add salt and butter to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and about a tablespoon or more of butter for each blender batch). Since you are using only lightly salted cooking water for a base, not stock, you will need to salt this more than you would otherwise.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Serve:</h3>
        
        <p>Serve immediately into bowls. Drizzle olive oil over the top and sprinkle with chopped chives.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
